Flight and Flight Modes
=======================

Standard (Altitude Hold)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standard mode will allow for full manual control during flight. When the throttle stick is directly between throttle up and throttle down (defined as 50% throttle) the Iris + will hold its altitude. Any movement above 50% will cause the Iris + to increase its altitude and any movement below 50% will cause the Iris + to decrease its altitude. By moving the pitch down the Iris + will move forward and by moving the pitch up the Iris + will move backward. Rolling left will move the Iris + left while rolling right will move the Iris + right.  

Loiter (Altitude and GPS Hold)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Loiter mode will acts the same as standard mode in every way except for holdinga GPS coordinate. While in loiter mode and having both control sticks in their neutral position (50% throttle, no pitch or roll) the Iris + will hold its altitude and hold its GPS position.

Auto (Autonomous Waypoint Following)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Auto mode allows the user to utilize multiple pre-programmed autonomous waypoint following modes or to send the Iris + custom, autonomous commands. More on autonomous modes can be found under `additional flight modes <http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/flying-arducopter/flight-modes/>`_.
