The Iris Plus quadcopter offers waypoint following autonomy along with open-source software allowing custom flight patterns. The pixhawk flight control board runs using `APM: copter firmware <http://copter.ardupilot.com>`_. Important aspects to flight include the RC controller, good understanding of flight and different flight modes, knowledge of what each failsafe means, and proper installation of ground station control.
